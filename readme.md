# Collaborative Clustering App with Django

Welcome to our Collaborative Clustering App, a powerful tool that leverages a sophisticated clustering algorithm within the Django framework. This app is designed to provide valuable insights and organization to your data, utilizing the TMDB dataset as the foundation for its collaborative clustering capabilities.

## Features

- **Collaborative Clustering Algorithm:** Our app employs a state-of-the-art collaborative clustering algorithm that enhances the organization and structure of your data.
  
- **TMDB Dataset:** The app is built upon the TMDB dataset, ensuring a rich and diverse set of data for comprehensive analysis and clustering.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - **Data Cleaning:** Robust data cleaning processes ensure the integrity and reliability of your dataset.
  - **Text Vectorization:** Utilizing a bag of words approach, we transform textual data into numerical vectors for effective analysis.
  - **Cosine Similarity:** The app calculates cosine similarity on these vectors, providing a measure of similarity between different data points.

## How It Works

1. **Collaborative Clustering:** The app leverages collaborative clustering to group similar data points together, enhancing the overall organization and understanding of your dataset.

2. **TMDB Dataset Integration:** With the TMDB dataset at its core, the app ensures a diverse and comprehensive set of data for clustering and analysis.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** The app performs in-depth exploratory data analysis, including rigorous data cleaning, text vectorization, and cosine similarity calculations.
